  <h2>Can I rent biking gear as well?</h2>
  <p>
  All of our rental bikes are electric. All bikes are provided with a helmet and cable lock. Overnight ebike rentals are provided with a charger for charging the bike overnight. If you plan to ride at night we can provide front and rear lights.
  </p>

  <h2>What types of bikes are available?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Juiced U500 compact cargo bike</h3>
      <p>This is a very comfortable bike with a 40 mile range. It is an excellent hill climber. It can carry lots of stuff including small people. We have one of these bikes available for rent.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Electric mountain bikes</h3>
      <p>These bikes are faster than the U500 but require a rider who is used to an athletic riding posture and who is used to changing gears appropriately for climbing hills. They have a 25-mile range. They weigh only slightly more than a non-electric bike. We have three of these bikes available.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Yuba Mundo electric cargo bike.</h3>
      <p>We can fit child seats or rails to these bikes to carry kids. They can also be used to carry loads of a few hundred pounds. We have one of these bikes available for rent.</p>
